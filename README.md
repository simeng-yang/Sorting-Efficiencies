# Sorting-Efficiencies

Programs runs through various sorting algorithms and tests their execution times over various sizes of data sets:
1. Selection sort
2. Bubble sort
3. Merge sort
4. Quick sort
5. Bucket sort

Attached is an analysis of the efficiencies of tested sorting algorithms, the raw data and test results.
