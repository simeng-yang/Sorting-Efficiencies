# Sorting-Efficiencies

Programs runs through various sorting algorithms and tests their execution times over various sizes of data sets:
1. Selection sort
2. Bubble sort
3. Merge sort
4. Quick sort
5. Bucket sort

Bucket sort is also explained, but not computationally tested with a data set. 

Attached is an analysis of the efficiencies of tested sorting algorithms, the raw data and test results.
